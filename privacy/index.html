<p>Our website address is: <a href="https://www.bitloco.org/">https://www.bitloco.org</a></p>
<h2 id="what-personal-data-we-collect-and-why-we-collect-it">What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
<p>An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service Privacy Policy is available here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
<h2 id="media">Media</h2>
<p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>
<h2 id="contact-forms">Contact forms</h2>
<p>You agree to have your data stored for the purpose of processing your message to us.</p>
<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
<p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
<p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
<p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
<h2 id="embedded-content-from-other-websites">Embedded content from other websites</h2>
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>
<p>We use Matomo for privacy-friendly analytics. No personal data is collected, and no cookies are used.</p>
<h2 id="who-we-share-your-data-with">Who we share your data with</h2>
<p>Cloudflare (indirectly) – Please see <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/</a></p>
<h2 id="how-long-we-retain-your-data">How long we retain your data</h2>
<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
<p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
<h2 id="what-rights-you-have-over-your-data">What rights you have over your data</h2>
<p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-send-your-data">Where we send your data</h2>
<p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service known as Akismet.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare">Cloudflare</h2>
<p>The website is protected by Cloudflare, meaning they get to see everything between you “the user” and the destination server. We get to see anonymized statistics like country of origin. So, in general, expect statistics to be gathered about your visit. The data transmitted between you and Cloudflare is protected by TLS (“HTTPS”) which you can verify by the “lock” icon in your browser. Cloudflare may place cookies.</p>
<h2 id="in-game">In-Game</h2>
<p>We log everything that happens in-game. This means things like the chat messages, when a user joins and leaves (and where they joined from, including IP). We may even log every block you place and break, including the time when it happened.</p>
<p>This is so that we can review, kick or ban bad players, and to be able to revert malicious changes in-game.</p>
<h2 id="server-logs">Server Logs</h2>
<p>This server keeps logs, so-called “access”, “error” and “security” logs, which log the full URL, User-Agent and IP address.</p>
<p>The access logs do log every request, this is to be able to detect strange or malicious behavior. The error logs do log errors so that we can detect and fix them. The security logs do log log-ins and failed login attempts, this is to be able to block malicious IPs and maintain website security.</p>
<h2 id="e-mail">E-Mail</h2>
<p>We do not have control over the e-mail server(s) as we use a third-party provider. The provider is mailbox.org which focuses on privacy and security. See here for more info: <a href="https://mailbox.org/en/security">https://mailbox.org/en/security</a></p>
<p>Do not send sensitive data over email.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-like-it">Don’t like it?</h2>
<p>If you don’t like it, don’t play on our servers and don’t e-mail us. Also, clear your browser cache and cookies and don’t return.</p>
